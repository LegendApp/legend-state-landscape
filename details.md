# Legend State

Legend-State is a super fast all-in-one state and sync library that lets you write less code to make faster apps.

## Features

- **Works with any backend**: The sync engine is fully client-side and supports any backend, with existing plugins for Keel, Supabase, Firebase, and more.
- **Fastest React State library**: Legend State is primarily a performance and DX focused state library for React.
- **Use server data as state**: The state defines how to syncs, so your app just consumes and updates state, which syncs itself whenever it changes.
- **Open-source**: The code is available for anyone to use and contribute to.
- **Community-driven**: Join our community and help us improve the project.

## Works with any backend

Legend State currently has plugins for popular backends: [Keel](https://keel.so/developers), [Supabase](https://www.supabase.com/), and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). It also has plugins to hook up your own backend using [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/) or you can easily build your own [custom sync plugin](https://www.legendapp.com/open-source/state/v3/sync/crud/).
